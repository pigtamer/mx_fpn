mx_fpn

This is an implementation of FPN in mxnet dedicated to multiscale optimization in small object detections.

Caution: I am also a newbie working on object detection, with MXNet in particular.

This project is still under development and needs optimization. Currently, the test result is by no means satisfying. Please refer to re-implementation of SSD for more details.
